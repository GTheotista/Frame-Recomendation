# Retail Eyewear Recommendation System

## Overview
This project involves developing a recommendation system for one of Indonesia's leading eyewear retailers on 2021. The primary objective is to enhance the shopping experience by providing personalized eyewear recommendations based on customer preferences and historical interactions.

## Project Description

### **Objective**
The goal is to create a recommendation system that understands customer preferences and provides accurate and relevant eyewear suggestions. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the system aims to:
- Increase customer satisfaction
- Boost sales
- Foster brand loyalty

### **Data**
The recommendation system relies on a structured dataset containing information about:
- **Eyewear Products:** Frame style, material, color, pricing, and other attributes
- **Customer Preferences:** Past purchases, browsing history, and feedback
- **Interaction Data:** Click-through rates, purchase frequency, and user ratings

A high-quality dataset is crucial for the accuracy and reliability of the recommendation engine.

### **Recommendation Generation**
The core of the project lies in the recommendation engine, which employs collaborative filtering techniques, such as **cosine similarity**, to identify similar eyewear products. The system generates a list of personalized recommendations by analyzing:
- Customer-item interactions
- Item-to-item similarities
- User purchase behavior

### **Output**
The recommendations are presented in a user-friendly format on the retailer's online platform. Each recommendation includes:
- **Product Name & Image:** To help customers visualize options
- **Confidence Score:** The system’s level of certainty in the recommendation
- **Customization Options:** Filters based on user preferences

### **Customization & Flexibility**
The system is designed to be adaptable to different business needs, allowing for:
- Feature selection tuning to improve recommendation accuracy
- Customizable preprocessing steps to match the retailer’s dataset
- Experimentation with alternative recommendation techniques (e.g., hybrid models)

## Usage
Customers can engage with the recommendation system via the retailer’s online and offline store. The system continuously learns from user behavior and adapts recommendations to improve their shopping experience.

## Future Enhancements
To further enhance the system, future updates may include:
- **Real-Time Recommendations:** Adjusting suggestions dynamically based on live user interactions
- **Advanced AI Techniques:** Implementing deep learning-based recommendation models
- **User Feedback Integration:** Leveraging direct customer input to refine suggestions

## Repository Security
The repository hosted on AWS has been **censored and secured** to prevent unauthorized access and data leakage to external parties.
